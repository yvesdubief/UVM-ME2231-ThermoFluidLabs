# UVM ME2231 Thermo Fluid Labs

Instructor/Author: Yves Dubief
Mode: 1 Lecture a week + 1 Lab session a week
Credit: 2

## Course Description
Technical writing, engineering measurements, data analysis and theory of experimentation.
Experiments with fluids and instrumentation for dynamic measurements.

## Prerequisite(s)
* ME 1120, ME 1140 or CEE 2100, ME 1210, MATH 3201. Co-requisite: ME 2230
* Python

## Text:
Writing in Engineering: A Brief Guide, Robert Irish.  

## Course Objectives
* Data collection
  * Students learn to collect data necessary to analyze a physical process
  * Students understand measurement errors and uncertainties and apply uncertainty propagation when the quantity of interest is derived from the measured quantities
  * Students develop the capacity to discuss results of their experiments to analyze and explain a physical process on the basis of available theory and 
* Using Disciplinary or Field-Based Frameworks 
  * Students understand and can apply increasingly complex disciplinary approaches to reading, writing, and working with information 
  * Students learn and use the language and methods of a discipline or field 
* Developing Flexible Writing and Inquiry Processes 
  * Students become aware that writing and information literacy develop via flexible and iterative processes 
  * Students develop the capacity to reflect on and improve their processes and performances 
* Using Information Ethically 
  * Students credit others whose work they have consulted or used 
  * Students have awareness of the processes by which information is generated and accessed in a discipline or field 
  * Students handle data and source material ethically and with integrity in a discipline or field
